        <p>
            A web page is made up of tags that form a tree structure known as the DOM.
            DOM stands for "Document Object Model".
        </p>

        <p>
            In Chrome, you can view the DOM by
            <br/>
            <ol>
             <li>typing "F12" to open the developer console</li>
             <li>selecting the "Elements" tab on the top left of the console</li>
            </ol>
        </p>



        <!--
             This is the "canvas" node. It's tag id "div" which is basically a general purpose
             block of content within the body of the page's document.

             The script below will reference this node by it's "id" or identifier attribute

             The node's id is "canvas"

        <script>

            // Inside a script TAG, a double slash makes the line a comment.
            // This is a basic script that generates some "p", or "paragraph"
            // nodes within the "div#canvas" element above.

            // Within a script, "const" is one way to declare a variable.
            //      (Note: others variable declaration keywords are "let" or "var",
            //       but "const" is usually the right choice)
            //
            // "document" refers to the entire page
            // "getElementById" is a "function" on document that will find the "node" with that ID
            //      Note: a node's "id" should be unique within the document
            //
            // After the next line, the script has a "canvasNode" variable that references
            // the "div#canvas" node above.
            const canvasNode = document.getElementById('canvas');


            // declare an "array" which is basically an ordered list of items

            const blocks = [1,2,3];


            // Here we are declaring a function to add a block of content to the canvas node
            // the function's parameter list, that is, the stuff between the parenthesis "(...)"
            // takes a single parameter "t" which will contain text that will be placed inside the
            // created element
            function addBlock( t ) {
                var p = document.createElement("p");        // create a "p" tag element node in the page's document.
                p.innerHTML = t;    // put some HTML code into the node

                // append the "p" paragraph element to the "canvasNode" element
                // this will add "p" to end of any content already inside the "canvasNode" element
                canvasNode.append(p);
            }
            // (end of the "addBlock" function)
